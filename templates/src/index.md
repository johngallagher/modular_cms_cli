      - heading: 'Diagnosing Incidents Takes Hours '
        summary: >-
          Ever felt like you're chasing shadows? Debugging incidents without
          observability is just that. Imagine it's 2 AM - you're squinting at
          logs trying to figure out why your app just tanked. Not fun, right?


          Observability transforms your bug hunt into a guided tour. No more
          guesswork, just straight answers. And yes, you can actually sleep
          peacefully at night.

      - heading: 'App Health Is a Mystery '
        summary: >-
          You're driving blindfolded. That's you managing a Rails app without
          observability. System health? A big question mark. CPU spikes, memory
          leaks, and you’re none the wiser until your app slows to a crawl—or
          worse, crashes.
        icon: outline-question-circle
      - heading: 'Improving Performance Is A Wild Goose Chase '
        summary: >-
          Performance bottlenecks are sneaky, and without the right tools,
          they're nearly invisible. Trying to connect a profiler to a Rails app
          in production? Good luck with that.


          Even if you can figure out the slow areas of the app, without
          observability you can't accurately determine why they're slow.

      - heading: 'Background Jobs Are A Black Box '
        summary: >-
          Those background jobs you rely on? They can fail silently and
          spectacularly. Without observability, you won’t know until it’s too
          late. Emails undelivered, reports half-baked—chaos ensues.

      - heading: 'Wasted Engineering Time Reinventing The Wheel '
        summary: >-
          Rails is a "batteries included" framework, but that doesn't seem to
          apply to observability.


          Logging has been a weak point in the ecosystem. Structured logging is
          coming in Rails 8, but none of the other observability best practices
          come out of the box.


          Every team I've seen has to start from scratch - writing Sidekiq
          middleware, adding metrics, and solving a ton of low level fiddly
          details.

      - heading: 'Quick Incident Resolutions '
        summary: >-
          Observability transforms your bug hunt into a guided tour. With the
          right tools, you get straight answers instead of guesswork.


          Real-time insights mean you can pinpoint issues immediately and
          resolve them faster. Say goodbye to sleepless nights and hello to
          efficient, stress-free debugging.

      - heading: 'Complete Health Metrics at Your Fingertips '
        summary: >-
          Observability removes the blindfold. Finally, your team can get a
          clear view of your app's health. Track background job queue latency,
          request errors, and other vital metrics in real time.


          This proactive approach helps you catch potential issues before they
          become incidents and before customers even notice.
        icon: solid-heart
      - heading: 'Answers Within Seconds '
        summary: >-
          Metrics capture the what (e.g. background jobs are failing) but they
          don't give you the why (e.g. a spammer is DDOSing your site). This
          workshop embraces ideas from Observability 2.0 to help you capture
          vital context alongside the metrics.


          End result? An app where you can ask any question you can think of and
          get an answer within seconds.

      - heading: 'Effortless Performance Optimization '
        summary: >-
          Observability makes performance tuning straightforward. With detailed
          metrics and tracing, you can identify and understand performance
          issues quickly. Find out exactly where the slowdowns are happening and
          why. This way, you can optimize effectively and ensure your app runs
          smoothly.

      - heading: 'Reliable Monitoring of Background Jobs '
        summary: >-
          Understand exactly what's going on with your background jobs. Monitor
          your jobs in real time to ensure they run smoothly. Get alerts the
          moment something goes wrong, so you can fix issues before they
          escalate.


          No more guessing if your jobs are working as expected - know for sure.
